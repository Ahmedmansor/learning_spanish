1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,000
you did it on purpose I can see it in your eye
لقد فعلت ذلك عن قصد، أستطيع أن أرى ذلك في عينيك،


2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,133
bona fide no disguise no more goodbyes
صدق، لا تمويه، لا مزيد من الوداع


3
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:27,133
slurring your words like you didn't care
تتلعثم كلماتك وكأنك لا تهتم،

4
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:33,400
notorious believing hearts in despair
مشهور بسوء السمعة بترك القلوب في حالة من اليأس

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,100
your index finger points blame at me

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:45,866
but it pacifies nothing can set me free

7
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:50,966
and all fairness I tried my best

8
00:00:50,966 --> 00:01:00,133
But delving too deep, it’s a heavy chest.

9
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:14,366
Lunatic, you called me so sarcastically,

10
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:20,300
Belligerent words that burned so fiercely.

11
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:26,033
Snagged in the web of your unsightly lies,

12
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:34,866
I couldn’t escape, no matter how hard I tried.

13
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:52,600
My intestine twists, feels the threat,

14
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,466
Surplus pain is all I’ve accumulated yet.

15
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:03,866
Your love was a weapon, used like a sword,

16
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:10,833
And I fiercely fought, but couldn’t afford it.

17
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:15,800
You were a storm, I was just the rain,

18
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,266
Falling so hard, swallowed by the pain.

19
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:27,533
In all fairness, I thought we’d survive,

20
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:36,466
But delving too deep, I’m barely alive.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,700
Lunatic, you called me so sarcastically,

22
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,733
Belligerent words that burned so fiercely.

23
00:02:56,733 --> 00:03:02,600
Snagged in the web of your unsightly lies,

24
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I couldn’t escape, no matter how hard I tried.

25
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:31,800
Now I’m left with the pieces, broken and torn,

26
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,366
Threats in your voice, so sharp and worn.

27
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:43,766
Fiercely you held me, but let me fall,

28
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:49,733
Surplus heartache, I’ve lost it all.

29
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:55,066
You did it on purpose, you knew what you’d do,

30
00:03:55,066 --> 00:04:01,633
Accumulated sorrow, I can’t get through.

31
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:07,466
In all fairness, I’m letting you go,

32
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:19,133
But deep down, you’ll never know.
