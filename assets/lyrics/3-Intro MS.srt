00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:03,900
hi this is AJ Hug, welcome to the mini story

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,600
for introduction to Power English

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,166
let's get started in the mini story

4
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:15,733
I will tell a kind of strange funny stupid story

5
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:18,066
uh usually actually I will ask

6
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:21,466
the story means I will ask a lot of questions

7
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:25,300
the reason I ask these questions is to get a lot of repetition

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,966
so that the grammar structure

9
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:31,400
the grammar pattern will go into your brain deeply

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,700
because you're getting again and again and again

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,066
you don't need to think about it

12
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:37,533
just relax listen to the story

13
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:40,200
answer the questions quickly

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,100
if you need to you can pause your iPod

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,366
pause your computer and answer the questions

16
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:48,166
or if it's too fast just listen

17
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,266
you don't have to speak speaking is optional

18
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:53,466
you can do it if you want to answer the questions

19
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:55,666
great shout them out

20
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,766
if you don't if it's too difficult

21
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,166
or you're in a train with other people

22
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,666
it's fine just listen and relax

23
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:05,600
it's okay too okay let's start

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,166

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,000
why was she worried?

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,466

00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:47,666
and Sophie was not good

00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:15,966
you will become a golf master

81
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:21,766
what did Sophie need to use?

82
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:23,433
her subconscious

83
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:26,900
Yoda said if you use your subconscious

84
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,266
you will become a golf master

85
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:37,866

86
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:40,700
a golf master he said

87
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,733
if you use your subconscious

88
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:47,500
you'll become a golf master

89
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,733
would she become a tennis master? 

90
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:53,800
or would she become a golf master?

91
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,700
if she used her subconscious.

92
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,566
well if she used her subconscious

93
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:07,200
of course, she would become a golf master

94
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,866
what did she have to use?

95
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:14,900
her subconscious, she had to use her subconscious

96
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,100
to become a golf master

97
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:24,700
who said this to Sophie?

98
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,133
Yoda Yoda said this to Sophie

99
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:32,100
what did he say?

100
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,200

you will become a golf master

102
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:44,333
so Sophie tried to use her subconscious

103
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:52,066
she closed her eyes every time she played golf

104
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:59,000
Yoda said use your subconscious, close your eyes

105
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:06,166
unfortunately it didn't work

106
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:11,166

108
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:16,466
she did not every time she hit the ball

109
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:20,866
it went into the trees

110
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:27,733
did Sophie try to use her subconscious?

111
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,800
yes she did, she tried to use her subconscious

112
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,966

114
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:47,100

143
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,900
