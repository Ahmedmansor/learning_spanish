00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:03,266
hello welcome to the vocabulary

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:07,733
for the introduction to power lessonsÙˆ let's start

3
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:12,333
okay let's talk about our first word is linguistic

4
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:21,300
linguistic means related to language or about language

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,466
it's an adjective so linguistic factors

6
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:28,033
I mention linguistic factors

7
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:34,200
a factor is an element for example it's a piece of something

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,933
so linguistic factors means elements about language

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,400
elements related to language

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:51,466
or even more simply things, things related to language

11
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:55,466
and then in this talk I talk about non linguistic factors

12
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:59,900
of course non means not it's negative

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:09,633
so, non linguistic factors means things not about language

14
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:14,533
things not related to language

15
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:19,733
so in the talk I'm talking about for example two different things

16
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:27,466
1 are emotional factors emotional elements,emotional things

17
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:30,233
and then the other is linguistic factors

18
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:34,866
so for example study method, that's a linguistic factor

19
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:38,400
it's connected to language learning very directly

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,400
it's a linguistic factor it's a language related thing

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,366
on the other hand emotion is not directly related

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,366
is not directly connected to language learning

23
00:01:54,533 --> 00:02:00,933
makes most people don't think so, so it's a non linguistic factor

24
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:05,533
alright great, so that's linguistic and factor

25
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:07,800
let's talk about next subconscious

26
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,700
I mention the word subconscious

27
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,233
sometimes you hear the word unconscious is another uh

28
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:18,033
synonym for that but subconscious means something 

29
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:23,500
that is under your normal thinking

30
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,466
so for example if you're quite hungry

31
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:31,066
suddenly you find that you're hungry but you're busy

32
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,466
you're thinking about something else

33
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:34,700
you're reading a book

34
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,833
but kind of under your thinking you have this idea

35
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,133
I'm hungry I'm hungry

36
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:43,600
I'm hungry it's not a conscious thought

37
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,433
it's not a strong direct thought

38
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,600
it's not at the top of your brain

39
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,033
he sub means under or below, so it's kind of in the bottom

40
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:56,266
the back of your brain

41
00:02:56,266 --> 00:03:02,200
this sort of quiet small voice or this quiet small um

42
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,900
thought so that subconscious

43
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,333
so I mention that you want to engage your subconscious

44
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:19,400
to engage means uh to use, to use or to like turn on

45
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,200
so to turn on your subconscious

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:30,600
to use your subconscious to engage your subconscious

47
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,400
it means you want to use those

48
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,100
emotions that are in the back of your brain

49
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,033
or the bottom of your brain

50
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:42,300
you want to use that quiet voice you want to use those

51
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,433
strong emotions that are kind of in the back

52
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:47,900
because they're very powerful

53
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,833
so engage your subconscious means use those means

54
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:55,733
choose to use them in a powerful way

55
00:03:55,833 --> 00:04:02,733
I also talk about engaging your physiology physiology

56
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:08,800
physiology means related to the body

57
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:12,533
it's related to the word physical physical means body

58
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:16,433
something that is connected to your body or in your body

59
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,066
and not your brain not your mind

60
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:22,333
it's body and physiology again is a similar idea

61
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:26,100
physiology means uh what is happening in your body

62
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,500
it's the systems in your body

63
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,933
it's the parts of your body so again

64
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:36,433
physio engage your physiology means use your body right

65
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:40,600
engage just turn on or use physiology body

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,000
so engage your physiology

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,200
engage your body use the parts of your body

68
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,333
use the systems in your body

69
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,733
that's what that means alright

70
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:55,666
great next uh, let's talk about the word peak

71
00:04:55,666 --> 00:05:01,400
so peak I mentioned in the main story peak means top

72
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,700
now often we use this to describe for exampleing mountain

73
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,633
the very top of a mountain we say it's the peak

74
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:15,433
the mountain peak the peak of the mountain the very top part

75
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:21,033
we also use it in the phrase peak performance

76
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:25,866
or performance means performing or doing something

77
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:30,633
peak means top so it means doing something in a top way

78
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:34,000
in the very best way

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,100
sometimes we use this with sports

80
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,900
so he is a peak performance athlete

81
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:43,400
he's a top performing athlete

82
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,600
he's the very best performing athlete

83
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:56,000
so that's again peak meaning top, very top or sometimes meaning best

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,133
okay so peak meaning top so emotional state

85
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:01,500
I talk about peak emotional state

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:08,300
so top or best peak emotional, of course feelings and state

87
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,433
state means um kind of your situation or experience

88
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:17,200
so an emotional state means

89
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:21,800
it's the general emotional feeling you have right now

90
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,200
so I might say I'm in an angry emotional state

91
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,533
that means it's kind of a long term idea

92
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:35,500
means generally for some time I feel angry

93
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:42,800
this is a very formal kind of academic or intellectual way to say I'm angry

94
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,833
okay, so this is a little bit more formal kind of English

95
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,100
but again an emotional state

96
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,300
it's a it's a general emotional feeling

97
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,133
and it has a little bit of the idea of a long time

98
00:06:56,133 --> 00:07:00,833
so a peak emotional state a top or best emotional state

99
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:06,133
it means feeling very good for a while

100
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,633
right, say I'm in a peak emotional state

101
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:13,933
I'm feeling very good for some time

102
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,800
okay now, that is the vocabulary lesson

103
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,733
for the introduction to power

104
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:23,866
of course if there are other words you did not understand

105
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:25,433
you can use the text

106
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:29,733
use the transcript and a dictionary and you know

107
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:33,466
just find the word in your dictionary and write it on the text

108
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:35,700
and you can learn more vocabulary that way

109
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:40,433
it's very difficult for me to guess exactly which words

110
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:42,866
you know and which words you don't know

111
00:07:42,866 --> 00:07:44,300
because every student is different

112
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,633
so I will cover some of the main words

113
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,000
the words I think are quite important

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,533
but if there are other words you don't know

115
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:54,000
just use the text and a dictionary

116
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:57,600
and write the meaning on the text it's fine

117
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,833
okay I will see you next for the mini story

118
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:03,400
thanks and see you again soon
