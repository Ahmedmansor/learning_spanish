00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,666
hi this is AJ Hogue

2
00:00:01,666 --> 00:00:04,000
director of the Effortless English Club

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,500
welcome to our new set of lessons

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,400
these are called the Power English lessons

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,600
the reason they're called Power English is because

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,533
in these lessons we're going to do two things

7
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:18,133
No.1 you're going to learn English of course as always

8
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:19,433
we have the mini stories

9
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:22,733
which are our favourite lessons for most of our members

10
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:25,100
uh but the content the uh

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,700
the focus the topics in these lessons

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,900
are gonna be focused on the psychology of learning

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,100
and the psychology of success

14
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,700
now these ideas they're not just my ideas

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,833
in fact they come from a lot of other people

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,733
they come from people like Tony Robbins

17
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:43,033
who's a famous success coach

18
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:45,400
um Robert Anton Wilson

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,433
Joe Vitale Robert Kiyosaki Alan Watts so

20
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:52,600
I've taken a lot of ideas from a lot of different people

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,300
about this this topic of the psychology of success

22
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:59,866
and the reason that we're going to talk about this

23
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:02,700
in these lessons is that in my experience

24
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:10,733
most English students struggle and fail because of psychology

25
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:16,400
not because of methods not because of teachers

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,033
those things are important

27
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:21,100
but uh you know Tony Robbins talks about uh

28
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,800
the fact that psychology is 80% of success

29
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:28,500
and I think he's right based on my experience with uh

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,500
many many English students

31
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,833
psychology is 80% of success

32
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:37,466
so 20% are the methods you use to study

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,800
twenty percent are are the schools you go to

34
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,200
the teachers you have the books you use those are important

35
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,400
we talk a lot about them, but the other 80% is psychology

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,733
your motivation your emotions

37
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,666
how you manage your time

38
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,833
all of these things are in fact much

39
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,833
much more important what I saw in my classes

40
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,200
were that the enthusiastic students

41
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,866
the energetic students

42
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:08,233
the optimistic students always Learned much faster

43
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:11,100
they succeeded the ones who failed

44
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,833
the ones who dropped out and quit

45
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:17,400
the ones who struggled had the opposite mentality

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,266
they had a very negative mentality

47
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:24,300
their motivation was low they tended to be pessimistic

48
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:28,200
they felt that they weren't good at English

49
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,700
they had ideas that English was very tough

50
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,800
very difficult they struggled there

51
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,866
they didn't have enthusiasm for English they didn't love English

52
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,900
so in these lessons we're gonna talk about

53
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,933
how can you manage your emotions

54
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:45,133
how can you develop that strong

55
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:48,533
powerful enthusiastic attitude towards English

56
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:52,200
how can you maintain it so that you don't get bored

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,433
so then in fact

58
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,100
you get stronger and stronger with English

59
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,900
and your psychology gets stronger and you succeed

60
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,200
you reach your goals

61
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,000
you speak fluently effortlessly so among uh teachers

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,933
English teachers language teachers

63
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:13,066
uh this topic is called non linguistic factors

64
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:15,133
non linguistic factors so

65
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,866
what non linguistic factors means

66
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:24,000
is things that are not related to language learning directly

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,266
when we talk about language learning research

68
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,500
when we talk about the

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,400
the best methods to use when you learn English

70
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,266
those are linguistic factors right

71
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:35,600
they're related to the language

72
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:38,733
non linguistic factors means not related to the language

73
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:40,266
this has nothing to do with English

74
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:43,066
it's more about psychology motivation

75
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:46,100
for example is a non linguistic factor

76
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:50,866
so that all it really means is just emotional factors

77
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:53,466
and there are actually many

78
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,800
research studies about this topic

79
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,100
Doctor Stephen Crashin down in Los Angeles

80
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,633
probably again the expert in language acquisition

81
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:06,733
language learning has done many studies

82
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:09,200
and he has also looked at many studies

83
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,800
and he's found that non linguistic factors are equally

84
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,800
or in fact more important than the linguistic factors

85
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:22,533
to determine who is successful ultimately

86
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,800
what that means is that things like your emotions

87
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,700
things like the your peer group

88
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,600
the community that you belong to

89
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,233
your feelings about English are as important or more important

90
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:40,633
than the methods you're using to learn English

91
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:42,666
so how we gonna do this how we gonna learn

92
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:48,166
well one of the things we have to do is create a daily English ritual

93
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:52,000
you need to engage your physiology

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,466
that means you need to engage and use your body

95
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:58,033
you need to engage and use your subconscious

96
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:02,200
that's how you start to affect and strengthen

97
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,533
your psychology

98
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,433
so we have to strengthen our psychology

99
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:08,333
what does that mean really it means

100
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:12,633
affecting your body and your mind at the same time

101
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:14,800
so that you actually feel better

102
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,933
your emotions are happier while you're learning English

103
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:22,500
and I know this is the opposite of what you Learned in school

104
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,233
you probably didn't feel very happy

105
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:26,700
when you were sitting in your English classes

106
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:29,100
but when you're learning with effortless English

107
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,700
it's very important for you to feel happy

108
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,533
for your body to feel good for your mind to feel good

109
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:40,800
for you to emotionally enjoy the process of learning English

110
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,100
of course it's just more fun

111
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,700
you're gonna like it a lot better but uh

112
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,400
the other benefit is that you actually will learn faster

113
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,900
you'll improve your grammar faster

114
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,033
you'll improve your pronunciation faster

115
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:54,900
you'll remember vocabulary words better

116
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,866
longer and faster when you feel good

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,433
so there's a very practical reason for doing this too

118
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:08,233
so we're gonna talk a lot in detail in these lessons about how to do this

119
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:11,000
but just right now during this introduction

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,733
let's talk a little bit about a daily plan

121
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:17,066
something you could do immediately right now

122
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:24,000
today to start improving your success with English

123
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,600
by changing your psychology

124
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:30,300
so here's a little ritual a little plan

125
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,400
you can follow every day to start improving

126
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:36,266
to start feeling better

127
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:38,500
and therefore improve your motivation

128
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,300
and to learn English faster and faster and faster

129
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,633
better and better and better and it's very simple

130
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,800
so the first thing you're gonna do is

131
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,033
when you get up in the morning

132
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:48,533
the first part of this plan this daily plan

133
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,900
you wanna get into a peak emotional state

134
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,933
peak means top for example uh

135
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:59,100
the top of a mountain we talk about a top of a mountain

136
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:02,033
the very top we call the peak

137
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,866
so we're saying a peak emotional state means

138
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:07,133
a top emotional state

139
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:11,000
or top emotional feeling means you wanna feel great

140
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,600
not just good you wanna feel really great

141
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,633
it's the first thing you need to do before you 

142
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:19,500
listen to any English lessons before you study

143
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,700
you wanna first be sure that you feel great how can you do it

144
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,533
well it's really easy uh I recommend

145
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,500
uh for example using music

146
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,200
and I actually do this myself in the morning

147
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,300
most mornings I will uh

148
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:37,400
put on some great exciting music that I love

149
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,833
jump around act like a crazy person

150
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:44,200
and get myself feeling energetic and happy

151
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,966
do that first before you listen

152
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:51,000
so move your body smile we're gonna talk 

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,466
about this  more in detail in later lessons

154
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:57,033
but just for now every morning when you get up first

155
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,900
put on some music some energetic

156
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,400
happy music that you like smile move around

157
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:05,033
do that for maybe five minutes

158
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:08,233
maybe 10 minutes then when you're feeling really great

159
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:11,066
your body's moving you feel like you have energy

160
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:16,566
you're happy then start your English lessons

161
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,133
the first thing you want to listen to is the main article

162
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,600
the main audio that's how you're gonna use these lessons

163
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,333
so the first thing is listen to the main talk

164
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:29,833
and you can read this as well the first time

165
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,766
if you cannot understand easily

166
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:38,066
you can read the transcript and listen at the same time

167
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,066
do this perhaps two times a day

168
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:43,766
starting with the main story and reading

169
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:49,133
use a dictionary if you need to to look up new words

170
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:53,233
next listen to the vocabulary so in the vocabulary again

171
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,433
I will discuss the meanings of some of

172
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:58,066
the difficult words that I used

173
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,900
and again you can read the transcript of that vocabulary lesson

174
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,866
there's always a transcript you can read

175
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:06,033
if you can't understand my speaking

176
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:07,933
if I'm too fast

177
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:11,433
then read at the same time it's okay

178
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,633
next you'll listen to the mini story

179
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:18,133
and the mini story is the most important lesson

180
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,966
the mini story is designed for deep learning

181
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:28,100
in the mini story I'm going to ask a lot of very easy questions

182
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,200
while I tell a story in fact

183
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,666
I really ask the story I don't tell the story

184
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,000
why am I doing this students ask me

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,200
why are the questions so easy

186
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:40,033
well the questions are supposed to be easy

187
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:44,166
because I want you to answer fast and automatically

188
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,233
I want you to train your brain

189
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,700
teach your brain to answer very quickly

190
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:55,333
I don't want you to translate from your language

191
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:58,733
to English or from English to your language

192
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:02,233
it's a bad habit it'll make you speak very slowly

193
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:06,766
I want you to just answer quickly automatically very fast

194
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,033
so that's why I ask so many questions

195
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:11,866
like questions again again again again again

196
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:17,633
very easy your job answer the questions quickly

197
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,900
you can answer with only one or two words

198
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,800
it's okay short answers are fine

199
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,900
you don't need to answer with a big long sentence

200
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,966
in fact short is better

201
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,800
so that's the uh the order that you're going to follow

202
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,066
you're gonna listen to the main article first

203
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:38,100
one or two times you can read as well if you need to

204
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:40,633
then you're going to listen to the vocabulary

205
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,833
one or two times each day

206
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,900
and then finally you're gonna listen to the mini story

207
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,133
one or two times or more

208
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,900
you can also read the transcript for the mini story in the beginning

209
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,100
now another important point when you're 

210
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,566
listening to these lessons do not study them

211
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:06,433
don't struggle to memorize just relax and listen

212
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,733
if necessary you can read as well as I said if you need to but relax

213
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:14,933
you're not trying to memorize anything just let it come in

214
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:18,433
let the English come into your ears and into your eyes

215
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:21,233
don't think about it don't analyze it

216
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:23,733
do not think about grammar

217
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:29,800
the mini stories will help you learn grammar subconsciously

218
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,033
so don't don't interrupt that process by trying to analyze it

219
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:37,800
don't think about grammar rules you want to learn like a native speaker

220
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,233
and that means you're going to learn the patterns 

221
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,766
of English in these many stories

222
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:47,200
you might not be able to explain them

223
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:48,300
just like native speakers

224
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,600
usually cannot explain grammar rules

225
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:53,466
but that's okay you wanna be able to use them correctly

226
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:55,533
that's the important part so again

227
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:58,300
you wanna relax do not study

228
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,533
do not think about grammar rules

229
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:04,000
do not try to translate just relax and listen

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,633
that's why we call it effortless English

231
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:08,033
it should be effortless you should be smiling

232
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:11,233
relaxed and just listening

233
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:16,533
another important point you want to move your body

234
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:20,133
while you're listening to the lessons

235
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:22,633
this will keep your energy high

236
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:24,033
so what do I mean by that

237
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:27,300
well a really easy way to do this is just to walk

238
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,533
you got an iPod you got the your earphones in

239
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:32,533
listen to the lessons while you go for a walk

240
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:35,033
you can do two things at one time you exercise

241
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:37,233
you improve your body and you listen to English lessons

242
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:39,633
and improve your mind at the same time

243
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,733
uh if you're sitting in a train

244
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:45,200
then maybe you just stretch your body a little bit

245
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,466
if you're in your car you can move a little bit

246
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,066
you can move around in your seat

247
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:50,633
if you're at your house you can go crazy

248
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:54,200
you can jump around you can exercise very strongly

249
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,333
you can go to the gym

250
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,600
do something with your body

251
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,433
while you're listening to the lessons

252
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:01,233
it will keep your energy high

253
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:02,733
it will keep you feeling better

254
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:06,166
you'll actually learn faster by doing that

255
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,100
and finally a very very important point

256
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,533
you need to use our deep learning method

257
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:17,266
that means you listen to each lesson set

258
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:20,000
for one week or more so for example

259
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,833
this introduction it's got three parts

260
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,766
there's a a main lecture a main talk

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,833
there's a vocabulary section and there's a mini story

262
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:32,733
well those three you wanna listen to those three everyday

263
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:35,033
for seven days

264
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:37,533
you want that repetition repetition is very important

265
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:39,466
you wanted to go deeply into your brain

266
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:41,900
just one time is not enough

267
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,533
even if it's very easy for you

268
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,866
if you listen you understand everything

269
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:51,533
it's simple still follow the deep learning method

270
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:57,266
still listen to the whole set for one week or more

271
00:13:57,466 --> 00:14:00,366
on the other hand if it seems very difficult

272
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,100
listen longer two weeks is okay

273
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,033
doesn't matter the point is

274
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:07,533
you want it to go very deeply into your brain

275
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:12,066
which means you want it to be almost um effortless

276
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:13,266
it's just gonna go into your brain

277
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:16,666
and eventually just come out without you thinking

278
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:21,133
and that requires deep learning requires a lot of repetition

279
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:23,866
so, that's kind of your basic plan for using these lessons

280
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:26,133
again first you're gonna get into a peak state

281
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,000
you're gonna get excited

282
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,266
you're gonna jump around you're gonna listen to music

283
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:31,100
you're gonna feel great

284
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,700
then you're going to listen to the the main lecture

285
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,800
the main audio one or two times

286
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,400
then you're gonna listen to the vocabulary

287
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,733
one or two times

288
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:45,400
then you're going to listen to the mini story one two three

289
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:51,200
four five times every day and remember relax

290
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:55,100
feel good and enjoy the lessons while you listen

291
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:57,866
okay that is it for our main section for this uh

292
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:00,966
introduction next is the vocabulary

293
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,366
I'll see you next time bye bye
